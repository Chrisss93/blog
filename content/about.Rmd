[CV](/vitae.pdf)

This is my personal website for keeping track of my projects and experiments in a more pleasing format than a GitHub page. I am mainly going to use the website to experiment with techniques related to statistical inference that I've not yet used on some cool data I've found/scraped. Every post should be accompanied with a GitHub repository which can be found [here](https://github.com/Chrisss93). My current interests change all the time, but as of June 2018, I am focused on:

* Non-parametric statistics
* Text analysis
* Markov chains and hidden markov models
