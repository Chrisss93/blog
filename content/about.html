<p>This is my personal website for keeping track of my projects and experiments in a more pleasing format than a GitHub page. I am mainly going to use the website to experiment with techniques related to statistical inference that I’ve not yet used on some cool data I’ve found/scraped. Every post should be accompanied with a GitHub repository which can be found <a href="https://github.com/Chrisss93">here</a>. My current interests change all the time, but as of June 2018, I am focused on:</p>
<ul>
<li>Non-parametric statistics</li>
<li>Text analysis</li>
<li>Markov chains and hidden markov models</li>
</ul>
